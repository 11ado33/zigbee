#### Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.occupancy }}"
    device_class: "motion"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery_low}}"
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
