Like most Yale Assure Locks, this model requires the [Zigbee Network Module (YRD-ZBM-1)](https://www.yalehome.com/au/en/products/smart-products/assure-lock-series/network-modules)

The lock can be set up in ZHA under Home Assistant by simply adding the device according to instructions that come with the Zigbee Network Module.
