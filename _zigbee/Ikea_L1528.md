### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npxOrPxVfe0)).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

While pairing, keep the bulb close the the CC2531 USB sniffer.

What works is to use (very) short “on’s” and a little bit longer “off’s”.
Start with bulb on, then off, and then 6 “on’s”, where you kill the light as soon as the bulb shows signs of turning on.
