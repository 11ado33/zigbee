Needs to be [flashed with Zigbee2MQTT firmware](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/flashing_the_cc2531.html). 

- USB connected Zigbee adapter with PCB antenna.
- Cheap but not very powerful, may not be powerfull enough for larger networks (30/40+ devices).
- Limited range, ~30m line of sight
