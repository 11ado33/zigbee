### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting `debounce` option with `debounce_ignore: - action` to throttle them without loosing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)

{% raw %}
```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: Symfonisk ikea volume
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
```
{% endraw %}

To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding `brightness` to `debounce_ignore` option

{% raw %}
```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: Symfonisk ikea volume
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness
```
{% endraw %}


#### Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
