#### Pairing
Long press reset button for 5s until the LED indicator flashes three times, which means the device has entered pairing mode

Sometimes the battery is not mounted firmly which prevents the device from pairing properly.
[Adding a washer between the battery holder](https://i.postimg.cc/SKkJmrpc/20210102-235846-1.jpg) and the battery or increasing the pressure on the holder fixes this.
