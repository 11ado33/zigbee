This firmware is a replacement for the original firmware for the __Zigbee__ chip JN5169 on __Xiaomi DGNWG05LM__ and __Aqara ZHWG11LM__ gateways which allows to use the gateway as a router (repeater-like) in any Zigbee network instead of the stock coordinator firmware for the propriate Xiaomi MiHome Network.
