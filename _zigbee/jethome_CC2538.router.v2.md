- Devices are working nicely with Zigbee2MQTT    
- you need to solder them yourself (parts are 0805), takes about 40 minutes per board
- Flashing requires a [JTAG Adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32833502027.html)
- All parts are on AliExpress - see [BOM](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x75iu18pmlnbv57/BOM.xlsx?dl=0)
