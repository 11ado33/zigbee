### Pairing
Open the back cover of the remote and find the pairing button. Reset the remote with 4 short pushes on the pairing button on the back (within 5 seconds) and a red light will shine steadily on the remote.

Now keep the gateway very close to the remote for pairing (red light will stop shinning when done).
