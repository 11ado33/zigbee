### Pairing
Short press both buttons on the blind (next to battery lid) for 5 seconds, until a white light between both buttons is turned on.
The device is now awake and ready to pair for 2 minutes.

Keep the Zigbee gateway very close to the blind battery lid, until the white light is turned off (this should mean the pairing is successful).
