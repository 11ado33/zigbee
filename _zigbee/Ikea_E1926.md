Includes models: E1748-60, E1749-80, E1750-100, E1751-120, E1752-140, E1753-60, E1754-80, E1755-100, E1756-120, E1757-140

### Pairing
Short press both buttons on the blind (next to battery lid) for 5 seconds, until a white light between both buttons is turned on.
The device is now awake and ready to pair for 2 minutes.

Keep the Zigbee gateway very close to the blind battery lid, until the white light is turned off (this should mean the pairing is successful).
