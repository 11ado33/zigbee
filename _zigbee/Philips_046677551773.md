### Pairing
Factory resetting a Hue bulb can be accomplished in 4 ways.
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

#### Touchlink factory reset
See [Touchlink](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/touchlink)

#### Hue bridge
When the bulb is still connected to the Hue bridge, you can simply factory reset the bulb
by removing it from the bridge via the Hue app.

#### Hue dimmer switch

#### TRADFRI remote control
This may also be possible with the
[Tradfri Remote Control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/tradfri-remote-control__0489469_PE623665_S4.JPG)
by pressing and holding the reset button on the bottom of the remote (next to the battery).
[This may not always work](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/296#issuecomment-416923751).

### Power-on Behavior
Allows to set the power-on behavior of the bulb.
Note that this requires at least November/December '18 firmware update of the bulb.
```js
{
    "hue_power_on_behavior": "on",          //default, on, off, recover, default = on
    "hue_power_on_brightness": 125,         //default, same values as brightness, default = 255
    "hue_power_on_color_temperature": 280,  //default, same values as color_temp, default = 366
}
```

Attribute Value | Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------------
default         | reset to factory default value
on              | lamps on after power loss with configured brightness, color-temperature, color (to-do)
off             | lamps off after power loss
recover         | last running state after power loss

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/configuration)*

`transition`   
Controls the transition time (in seconds) of brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.
