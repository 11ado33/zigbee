#### Pairing

Resetting the bulb:

Step 1    
Install your bulb in a light fixture and turn it on. (For best results we recommend installing the bulb where you can turn the power off at a wall switch.)

Step 2    
Turn the light switch on at one second and off at two second intervals (1second on : 2 seconds off) until the light blinks once to indicate it has reset. This should happen at the 4th full on-off cycle.

Step 3    
Turn the light off and pair the bulb with your hub via the mobile App."
