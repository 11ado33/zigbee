Actions: toggle, arrow left/right click/hold/release, brightness up/down click/hold/release

When clicking the middle (center) button on the remote it will send a `{"click": "toggle"}`, when holding it
it will **also** send a `{"click": "toggle_hold"}`. It is not possible to skip the `toggle` when the button is hold.
Also the remote won't send anything when the button is released. See [link](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2077#issuecomment-538691885) for more details. 

### Pairing
Pair the remote to Zigbee2mqtt by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the inside button, next to the CR2032 battery, 4 times.
The red light on the (front of the) remote will now flash a few times.
