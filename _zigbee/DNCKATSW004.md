#### Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state_bottom_left }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/bottom_left/set"

switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state_bottom_right }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/bottom_right/set"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.state_top_right }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/top_right/set"
