Tube's Zigbee Gateways are serial over ethernet zigbee gateways for use with any project that can access a remote serial device. 

The gateway is made up of a WT32-ETH01 module which is an ESP32 with ethernet and either a CC2652p Zigbee Module or an EFR32 based Zigbee module.

 Ideal for placing your coordinator in a central location. Stable ethernet connection - don't worry about disconnects! Eliminates the need for USB Passthrough when using HA in a VM environment.
