### Pairing
You can reset it and put it into pairing mode by holding down the button on the siren while plugging it in. You will want to keep holding it for a second or two after plugging it in until you see the LED on the button turn off, then release the button.

If done correctly you should see the LED blink 3 times every few seconds to indicate it is in pairing mode.
