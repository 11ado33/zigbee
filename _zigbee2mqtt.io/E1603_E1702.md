The TRADFRI control outlet also acts as a Zigbee router.


### Pairing
To factory reset the TRADFRI control outlet, press and hold the reset button
(pinhole underneath the light, located at the top (bottom if UK) of the outlet) with a
paperclip until the white light starts fading. Hold onto the button for a
few more seconds, then release. After this, the outlet will automatically connect.
