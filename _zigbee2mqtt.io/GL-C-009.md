### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/configuration)*


`transition`   
Controls the transition time (in seconds) of brightness,
colortemp (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
