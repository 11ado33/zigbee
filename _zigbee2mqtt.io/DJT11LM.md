### Pairing
Press the reset button for about 5 seconds. The LED lights up 3 times.
Then press the button again every 2 seconds (maximum 20 times).

*NOTE: When you fail to pair a device, try replacing the battery, this could solve the problem.*


### Sensitivity
The sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`
`{"sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITVITIY` is one of the following
values: `low`, `medium`,  `high`. 

{% raw %}
