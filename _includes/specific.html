<h4> Set default power on/off transition</h4>

Various Osram/Sylvania LED support setting a default transition when turning a light on and off.
<pre><code class="language-js">{
    "osram_set_transition": 0.1,            //time in seconds (integer or float)
}</code></pre>

<h4>Remember current light state</h4>
Various Osram/Sylvania LED support remembering their current state in case of power loss, or if a light
is manually switched off then on. Lights will remember their respective attributes
(i.e. brightness, color, saturation, etc.).<br>
NOTE: This must be executed everytime you make changes to a light's attributes for it to then 'remember' it.
<pre><code class="language-js">{
    "osram_remember_state": true,            // true, false (boolean)
}</code></pre>

Timeout (in seconds) after `no_occupancy_since` is sent. This indicates the time since last occupancy was detected. (example: `no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]` will send a `{"no_occupancy_since": 10}` after 10 seconds and a `{"no_occupancy_since": 60}` after 60 seconds.
</p><p>
<code>occupancy_timeout</code><br>
Timeout (in seconds) after the `occupancy: false` message is sent. If not set, the timeout is `90` seconds. When set to `0` no `occupancy: false` is send.
