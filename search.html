            To search exact match use `+`
            <br>
            For example: `+aqara +door ` will show only devices with "Aqara" and "Door" in their name.
            <br><br>
            You can exclude any term from search results with `-`. 
            <br>
            For example: `aqara -door ` will show all devices named "Aqara" that don't have "Door" in ther name.
